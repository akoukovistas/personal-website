I am a software engineer and technical project/program manager with a diverse tech stack, and experience in several business domains. I specialize in APIs, data engineering, back-end systems, system design, and architecture. I am proficient in multiple tech stacks and languages, as well as technical writing, team management, project management, and public speaking. I am bilingual (English & Greek), and I also speak Japanese, some Czech and learning German.

I am always open to new projects, however I don't have unlimited capacity. Please check [Contact Me](/contact-me/) for any business inquiries, or you can teach out to me on my socials for a chat.
